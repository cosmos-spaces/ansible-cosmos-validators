# Cosmos CometBFT Setup with Horcrux Support

This repository secures cloud provider servers, installs and configures CometBFT based chains for both, validator and sentry (relayer) nodes, and installs Horcrux using [Ansible]("https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/index.html).

## Design Philosophy
1. Secure server setup
1. Extendable to most CometBFT-based (Formerly known as Tendermint) chains
1. Support both mainnet and testnet
1. Support horcrux install and node config updates
1. Stable playbooks and roles; Customizable variables
1. Support essential functions (snapshot, state-sync, public RPC/API endpoints) through separate playbooks

## TL/DR
Run the desired playbook with the following arguments:

```bash
# Node Setup
ansible-playbook setup.yml -e "target=<mainnet|testnet|horcrux_cluster>" -e "ssh_port=<non_standard_ssh_port>"

# Install/Configure Chain
ansible-playbook main.yml -e "target=<mainnet|testnet>" -e "chain=<chain>"

# Install/Configure Horcrux
ansible-playbook horcrux.yml -e "target=horcrux_cluster|horcrux_cluster_testnet>"
```

## Architecture
For every chain where we run a validator on mainnet, we run 2 sentry (relayer) nodes connected to a 3/3 cosigner node horcrux cluster. 

Leveraging [Horcrux](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/horcrux/tree/main) provides high-availability while maintaining high security and avoiding double signing via consensus and failover detection mechanisms. This allows to connect multiple sentry (relayer) nodes to cosigner nodes, which reduces downtime and block signing failures, and increases fault tolerance and resiliency of blockchain operations.

## Node Setup
Typically, a cloud server provides a machine with root access and insecure setup. This ansible playbook is designed to address those issues. It is based on Ubuntu 22.04, but it should be applicable to other Ubuntu images. To run this playbook, you will need a user with sudo privileges. This playbook does not create a user on purpose as a security measure to avoid using root. This playbook will perform the following:

1. Set the hostname (based on inventory file)
1. Update server: Simply update and upgrade all applications shipped with the OS.
1. Install and configure essential software dependencies
1. Install ufw
1. Install firewall
1. Install fail2ban
1. Install cosmovisor
1. Optionally install node exporter (configurable in inventory)
1. Optionally install promtail (configurable in inventory)
1. Optionally install nginx (configurable in inventory)

### Secure Node

1. Disable the default ssh port of 22 and set up the alternative port.
1. Deny all incoming traffic.
1. Enable firewall to allow the ssh alternative port from the bastion/jumpbox ip.
1. Disable root account access.
1. Disable password authentication.

### Variables
Look at the `sample.inventory.yml` file. You will see an example of how the structure should be to configure your CometBFT clusters:

1. `target`: Required. Whether `mainnet` or `tesnet`.
1. `ansible_host`: Required. The IP address of the server(s).
1. `ssh_port`: Required. Alternate ssh port to configure on the server. This can be different per host. By default, it will apply the same port for all servers.
1. `server_hostname` Required. Sets the hostname to this value.
1. `bastion_ip` Required. Bastion/Jumpbox IP to allow ssh access to the server. It can be an address range as well.

Change the file name from sample.inventory.yml to `inventory.yml` and update the values accordingly.

### Run node setup playbook
```bash
# Node Setup
ansible-playbook setup.yml -e "target=<mainnet|testnet|horcrux_cluster>" -e "ssh_port=<non_standard_ssh_port>"
```

## Install/Configure Chain

As mentioned above, we run 2 sentry (relayer) nodes connected to a 3/3 cosigner node horcrux cluster. However, this repo supports configuring chain nodes as a `Validator` or as a `Relayer`, each with different settings described below. If you do not wish to use Horcrux, set the type to `Validator` for each corresponding node.

### Opinionated Configuration

We have 2 strong opinions about the node configuration:

1. Each chain will have its custom 3-digit port prefix. This is to prevent port collision if you run multiple nodes on the same server. For example, you can configure Babylon with the custom port prefix 109 and Osmosis with 110. It is up to you what port prefix to use.
1. Each type of node will have its setting based on our experience. For example, the main node (Validator) has null indexer, and 100/0/<prime number> pruning, and Sentry node has kv indexer and 1000/100/<prime number> pruning. We will force these settings on you unless you fork the code.

### Variables

Look at the `inventory.sample.yml` file. You will see an example of how the structure should be to configure your CometBFT clusters. All these values can be set per mainnet/testnet, host, chain or global.

1. `target`: Required. Whether mainnet or tesnet.
1. `ansible_host`: Required. The IP address of the server.
1. `chain`: Required. The chain network name to install/configure (should match file vars/<testnet/mainnet>).
1. `type`: Required. It can be `validator` or `relayer`. Each is opinionated in its configuration settings.
1. `ansible_user`: The sample file assumes `ubuntu`, but feel free to use another username. This user needs sudo privilege.
1. `ansible_port`: The sample file assumes `22`. If you ran the node setup playbook, it should match ssh_port.
1. `ansible_ssh_private_key_file`: Path to ssh key file.
1. `var_file`: It tells the program where to look for the variable file.
1. `user_dir`: The user's home directory. In the sample inventory file this is a computed variable based on the ansible_user. It assumes that it is not a root user and its home directory is `/home/{{ansible_user}}`.
1. `path`: This is to make sure that the ansible_user can access the `go` executable.
1. `node_name`: This is your node name or moniker for the config.toml file.

There are additional variables under `group_vars/all.yml` for global configuration applied to all chains.

1. `node_exporter_version`: Node exporter version to install.
1. `promtail_version`: Promtail version to install.
1. `go_version`: Go version to install.
1. `cosmovisor_version`: Cosmovisor version to install.
1. `cosmovisor_service_name`: Systemctl prefix for the chain's cosmovisor service.
1. `node_exporter`: Default is `true`. Change it to `false` if you do not want to install node_exporter. If true, enables the prometheus port in config.toml.
1. `promtail`: Default is `false`. Change it to `true` if you want to install promtail.
1. `nginx`: Default is `false`. Change it to `true` if you want to install nginx.
1. `log_monitor`: Enter your monitor server IP if you install promtail.
1. `log_name`: This is the server's name for the promtail service.
1. `pagerduty_key`: This is the PagerDuty key if you use TenderDuty.
1. `enableapi` Default is `false`. Set to `true` if you want to enable the api endpoint. 
1. `enablegrpc`: Default is `false`. Set to `true` if you want to enable the grpc endpoint.
1. `publicrpc`: Default is `false`. Set to `true` if you want to allow the rpc port on the server.
1. `external_address`: IP address to set as an external address in config.toml.

Look at `vars/mainnet|testnet/<chain>.yaml` for chain specific variables.

### Run install/configure playbook
```bash
# Install/Configure Chain
ansible-playbook main.yml -e "target=<mainnet|testnet>" -e "chain=<chain>"
```

## Install/Configure Horcrux
This playbook will install Horcrux, a multi-party-computation (MPC) signing service for CometBFT, on the servers defined in inventory.yml under `horcrux_cluster`. 

### Variables

1. `ansible_host`: Required. The IP address of the server.
1. `type`: Should always be set to horcrux.
1. `restart_horcrux`: Defaults to `true`. Change to `false` if you do not want the horcrux service to restart after a config update.
1. `nodes`: priv-val interface listen address for the chain sentry nodes to add to the config.

There are additional variables under `group_vars/all.yml` for global configuration applied to all horcrux cosigner nodes.

1. `horcrux_repo`: Repo URL where the horcrux code resides.
1. `horcrux_version`: Horcrux version to install.
1. `horcrux_cosigner_port`: Defaults to `2222`. Port cosigner nodes listen on.

### Run install/configure playbook
```bash
# Install/Configure Horcrux
ansible-playbook horcrux.yml
```

### Manual Steps
- Horcrux uses secp256k1 keys to encrypt (ECIES) and sign (ECDSA) cosigner-to-cosigner p2p communication. This is done by encrypting the payloads that are sent over GRPC between cosigners. Due to security reasons, this step must be done manually, and the key files should be copied to each cosigner accordingly after running the following command:
```bash
horcrux create-ecies-shards --shards 3
```
- Horcrux uses threshold Ed25519 cryptography to sign a block payload on the cosigners and combine the resulting signatures to produce a signature that can be validated against your validator's Ed25519 public key. On your local machine which contains your full `priv_validator_key.json` key file(s), run the following command and copy the files to each cosigner accordingly:
```bash
horcrux create-ed25519-shards --chain-id <chain> --key-file /path/to/priv_validator_key.json --threshold 2 --shards 3
```
- To avoid double-signing issues, manually supply signer state data to each cosigner.
